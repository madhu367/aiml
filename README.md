<h2>1. Healthcare Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb
<h4>Course : Applied Statistics
<h6>This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance</h6>
<h6>Skills: Hypothesis Testing, Data visualisation, statistical Inference


<h2>2. Thera Bank Loans Supervised Learning.ipynb
<h4>Course : Supervised Learning
<h6>Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one
<h6>Skills: Logistic Regression, KNN, Classification

 
<h2>3. Parkinsons Disease Diagnosis - Ensemble Techniques.ipynb
<h4>Course : Ensemble Techniques
<h6>This project involved using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalise the model for prediction.
<h6>Skills: EDA, Logistic regression, Decision Trees
  
<h2>4. Automobile Vehicle Sillhouette Classification - Unsupervised Learning.ipynb
<h4>Course : Principal Component Analysis
<h6>Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification.
<h6>Skills: Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Classification

<h2>5. Concrete Strength - Featurization Model Tuning.ipynb
<h4>Course : Feature Engineering
<h6>This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.
<h6>Skills: Regression, Decision Trees, Feature Engineering
