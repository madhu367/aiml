<h6>Skills: Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems

<h2>7. SVHN_NN.ipynb
<h4>Course : Neural Networks & Deep Learning
<h6>SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network.
<h6>Skills: Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Keras, Image Recognition
